# Code Review — PR #8: Implement validate and current commands

## Summary
This PR adds two user-visible commands (`validate`, `current`) and introduces a JSON-backed state module. Overall direction is good: the commands integrate with existing loader/paths utilities, use explicit status messages, and start a foundation for future `switch/list/show`. A few design nits and safety/UX improvements are recommended before merging.

## What’s Good
- Clear, focused command handlers wiring in `src/main.rs` (returning `Ok(())` now is an improvement).
- Sensible state layout: `.stand/state.json` with automatic directory creation.
- `validate` provides a helpful summary (env count + names) on success.
- Tests cover state serialization and path generation; CI should remain fast.
- Minimal dependency surface: `serde_json` only for state.

## Issues to Address (Actionable)
1) Do not `exit(1)` in library/command handlers
- Files: `src/commands/validate.rs`, `src/commands/current.rs`
- Problem: Handlers print and `std::process::exit(1)` on error. This mixes concerns and makes testing harder.
- Recommendation: Let handlers return `anyhow::Result<()>` and propagate errors to `main`, which is the only place to decide exit codes.

2) Color API mismatch remains in `utils/colors`
- Context: Prior PR introduced `purple()` usage; `colored` typically does not have `purple()` (use `magenta()`).
- Risk: Build break if a code path ever requests "purple". Current PR calls `green`/`cyan`, so it may not be hit now but is still a latent bug.
- Recommendation: Normalize colors to lowercase and map both "purple"/"magenta" to `magenta()`.

3) Test parallelism hazard in path tests
- Context: `find_project_root` tests change process CWD; parallel tests may flake.
- Recommendation: Provide `find_project_root_from(start: &Path)` and update tests to avoid global CWD changes (or gate with `serial_test`).

4) File permission hardening for state file
- Files: `src/state/persistence.rs`
- Problem: State may include sensitive info in the future; current write does not enforce 0600.
- Recommendation: When creating `state.json`, set restricted permissions (0600 on Unix) and document Windows equivalent. Also add `.stand/state.json` to `.gitignore` if not already.

5) Placeholder tests
- Files: `src/commands/validate.rs`, `src/commands/current.rs`
- Problem: `assert!(true)` placeholder tests don’t assert behavior.
- Recommendation: Add integration tests under `tests/` that:
  - Create a temp project with `.stand.toml`, run `validate` handler, and assert formatted output lines.
  - Round-trip state with `save_state`/`load_state` and assert current env behavior shown by `current`.

## UX/Consistency Suggestions (Non-blocking)
- `current` uses hard-coded green for env name; consider honoring `settings.color` if present so colors are consistent with `list/show` later.
- `validate` prints env names colored in cyan; ensure consistency across commands (decide on a canonical palette).
- Consider masking values by default in any future outputs that may show secrets.

## Security/Config Hygiene
- Add `.stand/state.json` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing runtime state.
- Document directory/file permissions for `.stand/` in `docs/requirements.md` (0600 recommendation).

## Merge Recommendation
- Recommendation: Request changes (minor). Address the handler `exit(1)` pattern, color mapping fix, and add `.gitignore` entry. The rest can follow-up quickly. Direction is solid and aligns with the roadmap.
