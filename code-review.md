# PR #7 Code Review — Foundational Utility Modules

## Summary

This PR adds utility modules for project root detection, terminal colorization, and CLI-facing error types. Overall, it establishes a solid foundation for upcoming CLI commands, with clear APIs and good unit test coverage written in a TDD style. A couple of issues should be addressed before merging (notably a color API mismatch and test parallelism risk). The rest are improvement suggestions.

## Strengths

- Clear error taxonomy: `CliError` provides user-friendly messages and a conversion from `config::ConfigError` to CLI-facing errors.
- Practical path discovery: upward traversal for `.stand.toml` and legacy `.stand/` is simple and effective.
- Focused utilities: `colorize_environment`, `format_default_marker`, and `mask_value` cover the immediate needs without overreach.
- Developer ergonomics: Re-exports in `error/mod.rs` and `utils/mod.rs` improve discoverability and ergonomics.

## Blocking Issues

1) Invalid color method: `colored` typically offers `magenta()` but not `purple()`. The branch `Some("purple") => env_name.purple()` likely fails to compile with `colored = "2.0"`.
- Fix: Map both input values `"purple"` and `"magenta"` to `magenta()`, e.g. `Some(c) if c == "purple" || c == "magenta" => env_name.magenta().to_string()`.

2) Test parallelism hazard: Several tests mutate the process-wide current directory using `std::env::set_current_dir(...)`. Rust tests run in parallel by default, so this can cause flaky behavior due to shared global state.
- Fix A (preferred): Refactor API to add `find_project_root_from(start: &Path)` and avoid changing the global CWD in tests.
- Fix B: Use `serial_test` to enforce serial execution for the affected tests. Avoid relying on `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`.

## Improvement Suggestions (Non-blocking)

- ConfigError mapping granularity: `from_config_error` handles `ValidationError` and `InvalidEnvironment` specifically; all other variants fall back to `ConfigurationInvalid`. Consider mapping common cases (`MissingField`, `InterpolationError`, `FileNotFound`, `NotAFile`, etc.) to tailored `CliError` variants to improve actionability of messages.
- Color input hardening: Normalize case (e.g., `to_lowercase()`), and consider using an enum for accepted colors to fail early on invalid config values. Optionally emit a warning or explicit CLI error for unknown colors instead of silently falling back.
- Masking policy: `mask_value` returns a constant `********` when hiding. Depending on UX goals, consider policies like preserving length with partial reveal (e.g., first 3–4 chars) or configurable masking.
- Message consistency: Some `CliError` messages duplicate guidance like "Run 'stand init'". Keep messages concise and avoid repetition, while ensuring next steps remain clear.
- Test count in PR description: The description states "35 passing tests", but the diff shows 24 new unit tests across the three modules. If additional tests were added elsewhere, consider clarifying for reviewers.

## Verification Notes

- Please run locally (I’m in a read-only sandbox): `cargo build`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`. The color method issue should be caught by the build/clippy, and the CWD tests may intermittently fail under parallel execution.
- Dev dependencies (`tempfile`) are present; tests compile as expected aside from the concerns above.

## Suggested Patch Sketches

- Color mapping example:

  ```rust
  pub fn colorize_environment(env_name: &str, color: Option<&str>) -> String {
      match color.map(|c| c.to_lowercase()) {
          Some(c) if c == "red" => env_name.red().to_string(),
          Some(c) if c == "green" => env_name.green().to_string(),
          Some(c) if c == "blue" => env_name.blue().to_string(),
          Some(c) if c == "yellow" => env_name.yellow().to_string(),
          Some(c) if c == "purple" || c == "magenta" => env_name.magenta().to_string(),
          Some(c) if c == "cyan" => env_name.cyan().to_string(),
          _ => env_name.to_string(),
      }
  }
  ```

- API refactor for test safety:

  ```rust
  pub fn find_project_root_from(start: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf> { /* ... */ }

  pub fn find_project_root() -> Result<PathBuf> {
      find_project_root_from(&std::env::current_dir()?)
  }
  ```

  Tests should call `find_project_root_from(temp_dir.path())` instead of changing the process CWD.

## Conclusion

The direction and implementation quality are solid for a foundational utilities PR. Address the `purple()` method and test parallelism first; then consider the non-blocking improvements for robustness and UX. With those changes, this PR looks ready to support subsequent CLI command work.
