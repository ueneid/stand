# CLAUDE.md

This repository now uses AGENTS.md as the single source of truth for all coding agents, including Claude Code.

- Primary guide: see AGENTS.md
- Workflow and TDD details: docs/development-guideline.md
- Architecture and requirements: docs/design.md, docs/requirements.md
- PR review checklist: docs/pr-review-guidelines.md

Claude Code should follow AGENTS.md and the above documents without divergence. If a conflict arises, AGENTS.md and docs/development-guideline.md take precedence.
