# Stand - Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

Stand is a command-line tool that simplifies environment variable management for developers who need to switch between multiple environment configurations within a single project directory. Unlike existing tools that automatically load variables on directory entry, Stand provides explicit control over environment switching to prevent accidental misconfigurations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Developers working on modern applications often need to:
- Test their code against different environments (development, staging, production)
- Switch between different API endpoints and database connections
- Maintain clear separation between environment configurations
- Avoid accidentally running commands with wrong environment variables

Current solutions either require verbose command prefixes for every execution or automatically load environments without clear visibility, leading to confusion and potential errors.

## 3. Project Goals

### Primary Goals
- Provide a simple, explicit way to switch between environment variable sets
- Minimize typing overhead for command execution after environment selection
- Offer clear visual feedback about the active environment
- Prevent accidental mixing of environment variables

### Secondary Goals
- Support hierarchical configuration (base + environment-specific variables)
- Enable both interactive and one-off command execution modes
- Work seamlessly across different shell environments
- Provide migration paths from existing tools

## 4. User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Daily Workflow
**As a** developer working on a web application  
**I want to** easily switch between development and production environments  
**So that** I can test my code with different configurations without manual variable management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can start a shell session with a specific environment in under 3 seconds
- The active environment is clearly visible in my terminal prompt
- All commands I run inherit the environment variables automatically
- I can exit the environment cleanly and return to my original shell state

### Story 2: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want to** run specific commands with designated environments  
**So that** I can automate builds and deployments with the correct configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can execute single commands with specific environment variables
- The tool returns the same exit code as the executed command
- No interactive prompts block automated execution
- Environment loading adds less than 100ms overhead

### Story 3: Team Configuration Management
**As a** team lead  
**I want to** define standard environment configurations  
**So that** all team members use consistent settings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can define common variables shared across all environments
- I can override specific variables per environment
- Configuration files use a human-readable format
- New team members can get started with example configurations

### Story 4: Mistake Prevention
**As a** developer  
**I want to** be prevented from accidentally nesting environments  
**So that** I don't mix variables from different configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The tool detects if I'm already in a Stand environment
- Clear error messages explain what went wrong
- I receive suggestions on how to proceed correctly
- No variables leak between different environment sessions

### Story 5: Migration from Existing Tools
**As a** developer currently using dotenv/direnv  
**I want to** migrate my existing configuration  
**So that** I can adopt Stand without recreating all my environment files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- I can import existing .env files
- The tool preserves my variable definitions
- Migration process completes in one command
- I can verify the imported configuration before using it
